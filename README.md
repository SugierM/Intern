# Intern Skills For Data Analyst
The Data Analyst Internship Insights Project is an initiative aimed at helping students and aspiring data analysts land their first job as data analyst interns. In today's competitive job market, understanding the intricacies of job listings and knowing what employers are looking for is crucial. This project leverages data analysis techniques and the power of data visualization to provide valuable insights into job listings for data analyst positions.

Using Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and the Django framework for web development, this project processes job listings data. It then extracts meaningful patterns, trends, and key qualifications sought by employers in data analyst interns. The findings are presented through an informative web application, making it easy for students to access and apply this valuable information to their job search efforts.
